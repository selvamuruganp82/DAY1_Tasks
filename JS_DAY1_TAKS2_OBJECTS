JS Objects are different than basic datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

In simple terms. “A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method)”.  This can be related to JSON (KEY and Value).

For example: Person, car, games etc....

Take the case of mobile.
All moibles  have the same properties, but the property values differ from mobile to mobile. All mobile have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

1) Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
	var Mobile = {Make: “Nokia”, Model: 1100, Color: “White”, Price :"4500"};

2) Object Properties
	The name:values pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties.

3)Object Methods
	An object method is an object property containing a function definition.
